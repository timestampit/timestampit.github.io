## Here lies timestampit.com

TimestampIt! was an experimental site for generating Trusted Timestamps. It was a fun site to develop and operate and taught me a lot about web development and what is possible with just a few bucks (a lot!).

If you are interested in purchasing timestampit.com, please email domain at timestampit dot com.
